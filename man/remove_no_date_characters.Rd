\title{Remove unnecessary characters from date-like strings}
\usage{
remove_no_date_characters(df_column)
}
\arguments{
\item{df_column}{A character vector (or data frame column) containing date-like strings.
Factors will be coerced to character. NA values are preserved.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as \code{df_column}, with
        unwanted characters removed. Only digits, letters from month names,
        and selected extra characters are kept.
}
\description{
This function cleans a character vector or data frame column containing
date-like strings by removing all characters that are not needed for
parsing or recognizing dates. It preserves:
\itemize{
  \item Digits (0–9)
  \item Letters that appear in any full month name (e.g., "January" → "J, A, N, U, R, Y")
  \item Selected extra allowed characters: space (" "), dash ("-"), slash ("/"), and "k"/"K"
}
All other characters (symbols, punctuation, letters not in month names) are removed.
}
\details{
The function works as follows:
\enumerate{
  \item Converts input to character vector.
  \item Generates the set of letters present in all English month names (case-insensitive).
  \item Constructs a regex pattern to match all characters that are NOT digits, allowed letters, or allowed extra symbols.
  \item Uses \code{stringr::str_replace_all()} to remove unwanted characters.
}
