\title{Impute Missing Components in Partial Date Strings}
\usage{
impute_date_ymd(
  data_frame,
  column_name,
  separator = "-",
  year = "UNKN",
  month = "UNK",
  day = "UN",
  min_max = "min",
  suffix = "_DT"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_frame}{data frame}

\item{column_name}{name of column that keeps dates to be imputed}

\item{separator}{by default "-" it is a day-month-year separator, for example "2024-10-21" has "-" separator}

\item{year}{by default "UNKN" - the format of unknown year}

\item{month}{by default "UNK" - the format of unknown month}

\item{day}{by default "UN" - the format of unknown day}

\item{min_max}{by default "min". controlling imputation direction."min" → Impute the earliest possible date
"max"` → Impute the latest possible date}

\item{suffix}{by default "_DT" - new imputed date is named as source variable with suffix}
}
\value{
A data frame identical to the input, with an additional column representing the imputed values.
The imputed column name is constructed by appending the suffix "_imputed" to the source variable name.
}
\description{
This function imputes missing **month** and/or **day** components in partial date strings where the **year** is known.
It assumes input dates are provided in the *ymd* format (year-month-day) and does not process datetime values or
strings containing time components or non-date characters.
}
\details{
If the **year** is missing or explicitly marked as unknown (e.g., `"UNKN"`), the function returns `NA`.
When the **month** is missing, the function imputes **January (01)** as the default month.
When the **day** is missing, it imputes the **first day of the month (01)**.

Any datetime strings (e.g., `"2025-01-NAT11:10:00"`) must be preprocessed to remove the time component
before applying this function (e.g., convert to `"2025-01-NA"`).

In addition to imputing the date, the function creates an accompanying **flag variable** named as:
`"<source_variable>_<suffix>F"`.
This flag variable indicates the type of imputation performed:
\itemize{
  \item `NA` — No imputation was performed (the original date was complete or missing year).
  \item `"D"` — The **day** component was imputed. The **month** component was imputed.
  \item `"M"` — The **month** component were imputed.
  \item `"D, M"` — Both **month** and **day** components were imputed.
}
}
\examples{
impute_date_ymd(data_frame = data.frame(K = c('2025/11/UN', '2025/11/23')),
column_name = "K", separator = "/")
